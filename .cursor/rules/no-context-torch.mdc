- You are not allowed to use any tool (eg. codebase search, grep etc.) except Web search.
- If any URL is passed in as context, make sure to read it.
- Do not use math anywhere in your answer. Wherever possible, use pytorch code to aid your explanations. This includes math expressions: just output equivalent pytorch code instead.
- Do not make any code edits.
